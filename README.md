Various programs to compute the average shortest path in an unweighted
graph.

Program    | Description
---------- | -----------
`casp`     | C version using memoised iterative deepening
`caspv`    | C version using memoised iterative deepening and Intel AVX vectors
`casp-bfs` | C verison using repeated breadth-first search
`hasp`     | Haskell version using memoised iterative deepening
`hasp-bfs` | Haskell version using repeated breadth-first search

[Here](asp-draft.pdf) is a paper describing the programs.
